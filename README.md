# MINIGAMES
This project is a simple game application written in C using SDL2. It includes two classic games: Pong and Snake. You can switch between the games by pressing keys. The code handles setting up the window, processing user input, updating the game state, and drawing the game graphics. It starts with Pong, but you can switch to Snake during play
